# Vehicle-Number-Plate-Detection-and-recognition-using-Open-CV-in-Python-google-Firebase-and-google-
In this project we are able to automatically detect vehicle number plates in python. After extracting the number from the vehicle we can identify the owner of the number plate through cloud using Google Firebase. Also, we will upload real time data of the number plate in the cloud using Google Sheets.
Use Open CV version 3.4 , do not use Open CV version 4 or above, the code will not run.
Use of pycharm is recomended.
You need to install several things in pycharm which is given in the import. Eg:- imutils, pytesseract, etc.
Install tesseract from this link:- https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
You need to see basic setup videos of Firebase and Google Sheets Api.
